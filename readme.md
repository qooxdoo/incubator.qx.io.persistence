# Qooxdoo Persistence Incubator

This incubator contains a proposal to add persistence to Qooxdoo; it's cross platform, while it comes with
an implementation for writing to a database the intention is that the mechanism can be used for any
situation where Qooxdoo objects need to be serialised - for example, over a network (see the
[Qooxdoo Remote Incubator](https://github.com/qooxdoo/incubator.qx.io.remote) )

This module should be considered **ALPHA RELEASE** and is subject to change without notice.
